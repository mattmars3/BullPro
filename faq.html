                    Yes, all of our clothing can be
                    washed like normal clothing. No special detergent or washing method 
                    is needed.

                Can this clothing become ineffective after time?

                <p>
                    Yes, our clothing can become more ineffective with time.
                    However, your clothing will be effective for 5 years. After 
                    5 years, we suggest you buy a new clothing item to ensure your safety.

                <p>
                    Yes, if you are convicted of a felony you will not be able to
                    purchase our product online. Secondly, if you live in the state of
                    Connecticut, you are not able to make any body armor purchases online either.
